## Featured Projects

### Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

This project delved into the application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques for classifying sentiment (positive or negative) within movie reviews. Leveraging key libraries like scikit-learn, NLTK, and Pandas, I meticulously preprocessed the text data, including tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming. To extract meaningful features, I employed the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighting scheme.

Extensive model exploration revealed a tie between two top performers: Support Vector Machines (SVM) with both linear and RBF kernels achieved an impressive accuracy of 89.9%. Due to its simplicity and ease of deployment, I prioritized the linear SVM as the best model. Analysis of the confusion matrix highlights a subtle bias towards positive classifications, presenting an interesting area for further optimization and potential exploration of techniques to address class imbalance.
